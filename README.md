## Explain Python Code

[explain_python_code.py](./src/explain_python_code.py) does the following:

1. It reads codes from the directory that contains a list of files. In this case, codes from [gpt-discord-bot](https://github.com/openai/gpt-discord-bot) is used as an example. 
2. It builds an input `prompt`, which is used to query the OpenAI API, by appending a `prompt_postfix` to the `code` read from those `.py` files. In this example, `prompt_postfix` is as follows:
```
###
Here's what the above code is doing:
1.
```
3. It configures the hyper-parameters for the OpenAI API.
4. It makes a request to the OpenAI API with the input `prompt` and hyper-parameters.
5. It formats the response from the API.
6. It writes the formatted response to a file in the `./output/explain_python_code/` directory.

*Note: the "Explain Python Code" section is written with assistence from OpenAI GPT.*

## Usage
Example: 

`python ./src/explain_python_code.py -i ../gpt-discord-bot/src/ -o ./output/explain_python_code/text_davinci_003/ -m text-davinci-003`

`python ./src/explain_python_code.py -i ../gpt-discord-bot/src/ -o ./output/explain_python_code/code_davinci_002/ -m code-davinci-002`

## Output 
The file [output/explain_python_code/main.py.output](./output/explain_python_code/main.py.output) contains reponse from OpenAI, that attempts to explain the code in https://github.com/openai/gpt-discord-bot/blob/main/src/main.py
